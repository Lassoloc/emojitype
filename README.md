Emoji Type is a Minecraft Fabric mod that allows you to easily enter emoji into text fields by typing a specific key word (e.g. `:skull:`).

### How it works?
This mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. 
To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones already in the game easier. 
For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc.) if you uninstall the mod.
I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that.
